# Financial Analysis Model Suite

This project combines two complementary models for comprehensive financial analysis and investment decision making:

## Project Structure

### ðŸ“Š Sentiment Model
Located in `sentiment model/`

The sentiment model analyzes financial sentiment from multiple data sources including:
- News articles and headlines
- Social media trends
- Market sentiment indicators

This model provides sentiment-based insights that help predict market movements based on public perception and news flow.

### ðŸ“ˆ Price Model
Located in `price model/`

The price model focuses on technical analysis using candlestick patterns to inform stock movement decisions. This model will analyze:
- Candlestick pattern recognition
- Technical indicators
- Price action analysis
- Volume patterns

## Integration Strategy

The two models are designed to work in conjunction:
1. **Sentiment Model** provides fundamental sentiment-based signals
2. **Price Model** provides technical analysis confirmation
3. **Combined Analysis** merges both signals for more robust investment decisions

## Getting Started
