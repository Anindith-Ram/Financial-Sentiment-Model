# 🎯 **Accuracy Improvement Plan: Target 50%**

## 📊 **Current Issues Identified from Training Logs**

### **🔴 Critical Problems:**
1. **Accuracy Stuck at 31.6%**: Model consistently predicts same class
2. **Class Imbalance**: Majority class (Hold) dominates predictions
3. **Loss Plateau**: Training loss decreases but accuracy doesn't improve
4. **Learning Rate Too Aggressive**: LR scheduling reduces LR too quickly
5. **Model Capacity Insufficient**: Current architecture can't capture complex patterns

## 🚀 **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Model Architecture**
- ✅ **Attention Mechanism**: Multi-head attention for sequence modeling
- ✅ **Residual Connections**: Better gradient flow and deeper networks
- ✅ **Larger Hidden Size**: Increased from 64 to 128
- ✅ **Better Initialization**: Kaiming and Xavier initialization
- ✅ **Deeper Classifier**: 3-layer classifier with proper regularization

### **2. Improved Training Strategy**
- ✅ **Reduced Learning Rate**: 2e-4 (from 1e-3) for stable training

## 🎯 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Run Enhanced Training**
```bash
python src/training/train.py --mode progressive --enable-logging
```

### **Step 2: Monitor Key Metrics**
- **Validation Accuracy**: Target >40% by epoch 10

- **If accuracy 35-40%**: Adjust learning rate and scheduling
- **If accuracy 40-45%**: Focus on data quality improvements
- **If accuracy >45%**: Fine-tune for final 5%

## 📊 **Monitoring Guidelines**

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Validation accuracy increases steadily
- ✅ Class predictions become more balanced
- ✅ Loss decreases smoothly without plateaus
- ✅ Attention weights show meaningful patterns

### **Warning Signs:**
- ❌ Accuracy stuck at same level
